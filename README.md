Hey I'm Xander, an aspiring full stack developer who has a passion for technology which stemmed from when I first built my own computer. Despite spending some time working in multiple different areas I have finally settled on my future career and hope to dive into the deep end of both front and backend development. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on buddie-up, a social network for gamers
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby (on rails)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with AJAX
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: xanderreardon@gmail.com 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I played enough hours on WoW to technically be considered a master (10,000+) ... I was not a master. ðŸ˜…

Among other things my hobbies and passions include, gaming far too much, spending copious amounts on hardware and throwing myself down a mountain with a piece of wood strapped to my feet.
